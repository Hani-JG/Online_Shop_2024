# Online Shop Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing an online shop's dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). The goal of this project was to visualize and derive meaningful insights from the data using **Power BI**.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains information about orders, customers, and products of an online shop.
